# Task-manager

A program that keeps track of all the tasks you have to do and decides for you which task is highest priority.

## Background Info

I am a college student computer science major. It is sometimes difficult to manage my work and decide which tasks are highest priority. I am writing this program to do exactly that. It keeps track of tasks that need to be done and calculates which task should be prioritized.

## Running

Until an official release is made, you will have to compile from the source code.

Compile the code using JDK and run TasdkManager.

Console commands:
>javac *.java  
>java TaskManager

or load the source code into an IDE like Eclipse or NetBeans and run it

Then follow the program's instructions.

## Built With
